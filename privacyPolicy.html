                    <p class="card-text">We use may use cookies on this Site to personalize user experiences. A cookie
                        is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be
                        used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you,
                        and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.<br>

                        One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For
                        example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site to
                        recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of delivering
                        relevant content, eases site navigation, and so on. When you return to the Web site, the
                        information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the site’s features
                        that you customized.<br>

                        We may occasionally opt to share aggregated site statistics with partner companies, but do not
                        allow other companies to place cookies on our sites unless there is a temporary, overriding
                        customer value (such as merging into Unboundeddata.com a site that relies on third-party
                        cookies).<br>

                        You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept
                        cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If
                        you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features
                        of this or other Web sites you visit.<br>

                        used by these service providers to place a persistent cookie on your computer. Doing this allows
                        the service provider to recognize your computer each time you visit certain pages or emails and
                        compile anonymous information in relation to those page views. Unboundeddata.com prohibits Web
